Verifiable Credentials 2.0 released on May 15, 2023
Making the expression, exchange, and verification of digital credentials easier and more secure

Provides a mechanism for expressing digital credentials in a cryptographically secure, privacy-respecting, and machine-verifiable manner, as well as an extension mechanism that allows specific applications (e.g., ID credentials, university credentials) to use their own terminology.

Credential owners can present them to verifiers, who can confirm that the claims are genuinely from the issuer and have not been tampered with. The authenticity and integrity of verifiable credentials are ensured through the use of cryptographic techniques, particularly digital signatures and associated mathematical proofs, to verify the structural validity of the content. This provides all three parties—issuers, owners, and verifiers—with a consistent trust mechanism for interpreting the data they provide or receive.

Owners of verifiable credentials can provide verifiers with a subset of their credentials (selective disclosure of private data) or combine multiple credentials into a single one. These so-called “verifiable presentations” are typically short-lived and are not intended to be stored for long periods of time. However, services for refreshing expired authentication information are also incorporated. The standards used for signatures and encryption are based on encryption methods that are widely adopted and deployed in the ecosystem.

This is a system that allows a third party to verify and confirm that your personal credit information (not limited to individuals) is correct.

In Japan, vaccine certificates were issued on smartphones during the COVID-19 pandemic.

In addition, in supply chains such as trade, there is a need to securely exchange accurate information among many stakeholders, and the application of VC is being considered.

On the other hand, DID, which is used in VC, is also called a decentralized ID, and is a system in which individuals manage their own IDs and share only the necessary information with the necessary people, replacing the IDs and passwords that are centrally managed by traditional companies.

For example, the California DMV (driver's license system) utilizes DIDs for verifiable certificates that identify the issuer and holder's devices. As of September 2024, there are 600,000 DIDs in use, with 1,200 added daily.

可驗證憑證（Verifiable Credentials）2.0 於今年 5 月 15 日發佈
使數位憑證的表示、交換和驗證變得更容易、更安全

提供以加密安全、尊重隱私和機器可驗證的方式來表示數位憑證的機制，以及允許特定應用（如身份憑證、大學憑證）使用其各自專業用語的擴展機制。

憑證持有者可將憑證出示給驗證者，驗證者可驗證該聲明是否確實來自發行者，且未被篡改。可驗證憑證的真實性和完整性是透過使用密碼技術，特別是使用數位簽章和相關數學證明，來檢查其內容的結構有效性。這樣的機制可確保發行者、持有者和驗證者三方，能對所提供或接收的資料有一致的信任機制。

可驗證憑證的持有者也可以提供憑證中的部分資訊給驗證者 (即選擇性揭露私人資料)，或是將多個憑證合而為一。這些所謂的「可驗證出示」通常是短期的，並不打算長期儲存。不過，系統中也內建了讓過期憑證可以更新的機制。
簽章和加密所使用的標準，是基於生態系統中廣泛採用的加密方法之上。
這是一種可讓第三者驗證和確認您的個人憑證 (不只是人) 是否正確的機制。

在日本的COVID-19 疫情期間，就曾推出可透過智慧型手機簽發疫苗接種證明。

此外，VC技術也被考慮應用在供應鏈中，例如貿易，在這種供應鏈中，需要在許多利益相關者之間安全地交換準確的資訊。
此外，在貿易等的供應鏈管理等領域，因為涉及多方利害關係人之間安全地進行準確的資訊交換，因此目前也在評估導入VC技術的可能性。

另一方面，同樣應用於 VC 的 DID 也稱為分散式 ID，它是取代傳統由企業集中管理帳號／密碼的方式，讓個人自行管理自己的 ID，並只與需要者分享必要資訊的架構。

例如，加州的 DMV（駕駛執照系統）利用 DID 驗證證書，用於識別發行者和持有者的裝置；截至 2024年9月，已新增600,000個，即每天1,200個。
